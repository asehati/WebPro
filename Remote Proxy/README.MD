Parser Fetcher is the status quo in proxy-based mobile web browsing. When a request comes to proxy, it will employ a web engine to load the page and then send all the objects of the page in one bundle to the local proxy. This way, the proxy incurs at least one RTT to fetc and parse the base HTML file of the page. It also has to go through the critical path of the page to load the page.

In contrast, Graph Fetcher uses previously recorded resource list of the page to load the page at the remote proxy. This way, the proxy is able to bypass the time required to fetch and parse the base HTML file of the page. This approach also enables proxy to avoid going through the critical path of the page.
