Local proxy forwards first page request to remote proxy and then waits to receive the page bundle from remote proxy. After receiving the bundle, local proxy will serve all the subsequent requests locally from objects in the bundle. If there is an object missing in the bundle, local proxy will directly fetch it from remote proxy.
